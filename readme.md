# Ask me anything!

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

I’m a frontend developer at [Here](https://here.com/en), [passionate photographer](http://morning.photos/), coffee drinker and crazy dogs’ owner living in Berlin, Germany.

I get some questions by email or Twitter. This way anyone can read the answer!

Frontend, open source, tools, blogging, photography, dogs vs. cats, etc.
